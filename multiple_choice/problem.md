## 1. Which of these best describes what a sentient node (a.k.a. dummy node) is in  the context of a linked list?
- a. A placeholder node used to indicate the end of the linked list.
- b. A node that contains no data but serves as a connector between two other nodes.
- c. A node with null data value used to mark the beginning of the linked list.
- d. A node that holds temporary data for computation within the linked list structure.

## 2. Which data structure is typically used to implement Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm?
- a. Queue
- b. Stack
- c. Linked List
- d. Hash Table

## 3. Which data structure is typically used to implement Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm?
- a. Queue
- b. Stack
- c. Linked List
- d. Hash Table

## 4. Which of these would it be most appropriate to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm?
- a. When the objective is to minimize the number of visited nodes during traversal.
- b. When the search space is small and depth is limited.
- c. When the main goal is to explore as deeply as possible along each branch before backtracking.
- d. When finding the shortest path in graphs or trees.


## 5. When should a backtracking algorithm be utilized?
- a. When the problem can be solved using a greedy approach.
- b. When the problem space can be organized as a graph.
- c. When the problem requires finding all possible solutions.
- d. When the problem involves sorting elements in ascending order.
